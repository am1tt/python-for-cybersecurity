## here we will see how to create temporary variables #

## this temporary variable will help us swap values of two variables such tha a and b ## 

a = 10
b = 20


temp = a
a = b
b = temp

print(a,b)

## here temp took the value of a and then assigned the value of b to a then finally temp(a) was assigned to b ##

## this is manaul swapping of values ##
