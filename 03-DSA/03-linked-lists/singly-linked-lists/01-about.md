## note : linkedlists is not an array 
## it consist of nodes pointing out to each other

## eg : 1 --> 2 --> 3  : 3 is the end m, numbers are the node pointing one after other 

## it has its memory address stored somewhere in the computer # 
## thats why its not like array , because array consist of contiguous memory ##



## overview 

## 1(A) ---> 2(B) ----> 3(C) ----> None

## what is linked list node ? : basically we have something called classes and classes create some thing called objects 

## so you would have : class Node : node.value , node.next (objects)


## also consist of (head) which is first node till ---> none , meaning if i want to delete or add a note , i have to traverse completelty form the head to the end
