## am1tt : well built in functions are somewhat integrated functions that comes with a language ## 


## eg ; 

name = input("")

## input is built in func 

x = 2

isinstance(x,(int,float))

## used in previous exception code , checks wether var is int float 



my_string = "Amit"

print(len(my_string))

## len gives the length of the string


x = abs(-23.4)
print(x)

## Prints the absolute value : abs


my_l = list(("a","b","c"))

print(my_l)


for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)

## range is also a built in func
