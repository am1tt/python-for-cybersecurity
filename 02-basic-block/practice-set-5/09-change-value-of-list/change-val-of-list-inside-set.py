## Q : can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set s ? ## 

s = {8,7,12,"am1tt",[1,2]}


## sets allow hashables or immutables objects 
## list is mutable though , so its unhashable 

## therefore we cannot change neither print it as it will result in typerror of list ## 

## to print 

s_print = {8,7,12,"am1tt",(1,2)}

print(s_print)

## we cannot change the value though ## 


## solved : am1tt
