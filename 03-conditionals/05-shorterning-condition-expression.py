## we will see how we can make an expression shorter using conditional expressions ## 

#eg : normal if else statment 

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("b is greater than a")        

#this can be shortened using conditional expression



#eg : conditional expression

print("a is greater than b") if a > b else print("b is greater than a")
