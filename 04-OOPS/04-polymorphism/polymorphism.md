### Polymorphism ? 
---
means using the same method name in different classes , where each class gives its own behavior when the method is claled 

- same method name , different behaviour 
- work accross different classes 
- makes code flexible and resuable

eg : 

```
print(len("hello"))
print(len([1,2,3]))
print(len({
    "a":1,
    "b":2
}))
```

same function `len()` works on different data types
